### Changed
- Metadata Service InstanceInfo, Group, and ClusterDefaults resources are now
  updated in place with CA verification; stale Omnia-owned groups are removed
  only when they have no SMD members.
- Provisioning-password hashes now use a stable project-and-cluster salt so
  unchanged cloud-init stays idempotent; plaintext is supplied to OpenSSL over
  standard input rather than a process argument.
- Provision, validation, and PXE workflows consume only SMD-resolved
  identities; the PXE mapping does not contain XNAME values.
- Galaxy version set to 2.3.0.
- Node-registration timing and verification use the
  `enable_node_registration`, `node_registration_pause_minutes`,
  `node_registration_retries`, and `node_registration_delay` controls.
- Node completion is verified directly through SSH, boot freshness, and
  cloud-init status.
- Automatic NFS data cleanup disabled for K8s and Slurm (#5589).
- Slurm data cleanup gracefully skipped when mount is unmounted (#5492).
- Cleanup behavior aligned with cross-domain conventions.
- BuildStream pre- and post-PXE processing separated (#5567).
- Unsupported upgrade and rollback flows removed (#5446).

### Fixed
- Removed the invalid generic cloud-init phone-home fragment; Metadata Service
  reserves that route for optional WireGuard bootstrap peer removal.
- Boot Service now uses the NoCloud datasource name `nocloud`.
- Disabled root filesystem resize for the live overlay image and made Slurm
  tracking mounts and controller-marker waits explicit and bounded.
- Inventory generation `Recursive loop detected in template` -- renamed
  template var from `kube_vip` to `inventory_kube_vip` to avoid self-reference
  when fact is not set.
- `validate_preamble` OIM tasks fail with undefined `pxe_mapping_file_path` --
  resolve from localhost hostvars and add defensive `when` guards.
- `validate_preamble` playbook uses `roles:` which doesn't resolve OIM hostvars
  -- changed to `tasks:` with `include_role:` for proper variable resolution.
- Metadata-service configuration fails with `File not found: nodes_slurm.yaml`
  during K8s provisioning -- `nodes_yaml` forced to current category (#473).
- `generate_xname_in_mapping_file` module replaced pandas with Python stdlib
  `csv` module (#473).
- `symmetric_difference` NoneType error on `--tags provision` --
  `provision_preamble.yml` was missing the first-control-plane rename step
  (#472).
- K8s nodes receive random DHCP IPs instead of ADMIN_IPs when both K8s and
  Slurm catalogs are provisioned -- `delete_smd_endpoints.yml` no longer uses
  `--all` (#463).
- Stale phone-home detection: verify node boot time is after PXE start epoch
  (#461).
- `failed_nodes.json` wrong count due to `set_fact` + `delegate_to` race
  condition when multiple BMC hosts fail PXE boot simultaneously (#460).
- Orchestrator inventory includes `kube_vip_group` even for slurm-only
  clusters (#459).
- Provision report shows wrong `missing_nodes` by comparing GROUP_NAMEs
  against xnames (#458).
- Missing `configs_vars.yaml` pre-check causes unclear error during provision
  (#450).
- OS-versioned FG names (e.g. `slurm_control_node_rhel_10_0_x86_64`) fail
  metadata-service template lookup -- normalized template path.
- Fail-closed input validation for orchestrator configuration (#560792c).

### Security
- Remediated shell injection, credential exposure, and LDAP TLS
  vulnerabilities (#5482).
- Security hardening for functional-group configuration (ER-ORCH-009).
- Callback plugin redacts sensitive keys from result dictionaries (#5604).
- Security input validation and cleartext memory remediation (#5600).
- Validate tag/registry inputs in container build scripts.
