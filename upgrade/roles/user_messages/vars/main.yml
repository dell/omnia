   STEP 1 OF UPGRADE: PREPARE_CONFIG COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY.

   Omnia 1.5.1 input configurations have been imported and populated into the Omnia 1.6 input files at {{ role_path }}/../../../input
   Backup of Omnia 1.5.1 database has been taken at the 'backup_location' as mentioned in upgrade_config.yml
   IMPORTANT: Request user to cross-verify the auto-generated configuration parameters, before proceeding further.

   Once the configurations are verified, user can trigger prepare_upgrade.yml as below:

        ansible-playbook prepare_upgrade.yml -i <omnia_1.5.1_inventory_file_path>

   Where <omnia_1.5.1_inventory_file_path> is the absolute file path of Omnia 1.5.1 inventory

   prepare_upgrade.yml cleans up the various software packages on Omnia 1.5.1 cluster and the control plane. This includes Kubernetes, Telemetry, etc.
   It also creates the Omnia 1.6 local repo, upgrades xCAT on control plane, and restores the Omnia Database from the backup.
   NOTE: Omnia NFS share of Omnia 1.5.1 is deleted while running prepare_upgrade.yml,hence we recommend users to take backup of the share before proceeding .

   STEP 2 OF UPGRADE: PREPARE_UPGRADE COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY.

   Omnia 1.5.1 control plane and cluster cleanup have completed successfully.
   On the control plane, Omnia 1.6 local_repo is configured, xCAT is upgraded, and Omnia Database is restored from the backup.

   User can now trigger upgrade.yml as below:

        ansible-playbook upgrade.yml -i <omnia_1.6_generated_inventory>

   Where <omnia_1.6_generated_inventory> is the Omnia 1.6 inventory file, auto-generated in Step 1, and is available in 'upgrade' folder
   After executing upgrade.yml, the cluster will be fully upgraded to Omnia 1.6
