#### Mandatory
# Path where user has placed the iso image that needs to be provisioned on target nodes.
# The iso file should be Rocky8-DVD or RHEL-8.x-DVD (full OS) or ubuntu-20.x-live-server.
# Value of iso_file_path should contain cluster_os_type and cluster_os_version values from software_config.json
# When cluster_os_type is ubuntu and cluster_os_version is 22.04, by default omnia configures generic kernel.
# To customize kernel flavor in ubuntu 22.04, define ubuntu_kernel_flavor as 'hwe' or 'generic'
iso_file_path: "{{ iso_file_path }}" # Value auto populated by Omnia 1.5-1.6 upgrade script

#### Mandatory
# Nodes present in mapping file, won't be considered for this node_name.
# Prefix for the node names, if needed to be dynamically allocated.
# Hostname = node_name + '0000x' + domain_name
# Hostname <= 65 characters.
# Example: servernode00001.Omnia.test , where node_name=servernode, domain_name=Omnia.test , 00001 used by Omnia
node_name: "{{ node_name }}" # Value auto populated by Omnia 1.5-1.6 upgrade script

#### Mandatory
# Domain name the user intends to configure on the cluster.
# Please provide a valid domain name according to the domain name standards.
# Hostname = node_name + '0000x' + domain_name
# Hostname <= 65 characters.
# Example: servernode00001.Omnia.test ,where node_name=servernode ,domain_name=Omnia.test ,00001 used by Omnia
# Examples: abcd.test, ipa.test
domain_name: "{{ domain_name }}" # Value auto populated by Omnia 1.5-1.6 upgrade script

#### Optional
# This depicts the path where user has kept the PXE mapping file.
# The mapping file consists of the Service tag, Admin MAC,Hostname and its respective admin IP address and/or BMC IP.
# Ensure that admin IPs given in mapping file are within the admin_static_ranges.
# A templates for mapping file exists in omnia/examples, namely, pxe_mapping_file.csv
# Format of csv: SERVICE_TAG,ADMIN_MAC,HOSTNAME,ADMIN_IP,BMC_IP
pxe_mapping_file_path: "{{ pxe_mapping_file_path }}" # Value auto populated by Omnia 1.5-1.6 upgrade script

#### Mandatory
# Variable indicates whether switch based discovery should be enabled to discover the nodes
# To enable switch based discovery, set enable_switch_based to true
# If enable_switch_based is set to true, Following inputs should be provided:
# switch_based_details should be provided in provision_config.yml
# switch_snmp3_username and switch_snmp3_password should be provided in provision_config_credentials.yml
# bmc_network details with nic_name, netmask_bits, static_range and dynamic_range should be provided in network_spec.yml
# Warning: If enable_switch_based is set to true, bmc discovery will be skipped.
# For enabling bmc discovery, set enable_switch_based to false and provide bmc_network details in network_spec.yml
# It accepts true and false values
# Default: false

#### Mandatory, when enabled_switch_based is set to true
# Ports indicates the port no. where the servers are connected on switch
# If split port is needed, use colon (:) as shown in example below.
# Example1:
#   - { ip: 172.96.28.12, ports: '1-48,49:3,50' }
# Example2 with 2 switches:
#   - { ip: 172.96.28.12, ports: '1-48,49:3,50' }
#   - { ip: 172.96.28.14, ports: '1,2,3,5' }
