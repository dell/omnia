# These addresses will be used by Loadbalancer for assigning External IPs to K8s services running on control plane
# Make sure the IP range is not assigned to any node in the cluster.
# If admin_nic network provided in network_spec.yml is in 10.11.0.0 network, then pod_external_ip_range should be in same netwwork like "10.11.0.60-10.11.0.70"
# Acceptable formats: "10.11.0.100-10.11.0.150" , "10.11.0.0/16"

##### BELOW VARIABLES ARE MANDATORY WHEN omnia_telemetry_support IS SET TO true
# This variable denotes the time interval of telemetry data collection from required computue nodes
# This variable accepts input in seconds
# Default value is 300
# Example 1: omnia_telemetry_collection_interval: 300
