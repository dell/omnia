# NFS bolt-on support, USER have to mount EXTERNAL NFS server, omnia will mount NFS client
# This variable is used for supporting NFS bolt-on on login, compute, and manager nodes
# Values should be entered in JSON format only.
# If mount_option values are empty, NFS client will be mounted with these values "nosuid,rw,sync,hard,intr"
# For enabling NFS bolt-on support, at least one list of valid values should be provided.
# Example for single mount file system:
# nfs_client_params: 
# - { server_ip: 198.168.0.1, server_share_path: "/mnt/share", client_share_path: "/mnt/mount", client_mount_options: "nosuid,rw,sync,hard" }
# Example for supporting multiple mount points:
# nfs_client_params: 
#    - { server_ip: 198.168.0.1, server_share_path: "/mnt/share1", client_share_path: "/mnt/mount1", client_mount_options: "nosuid,rw,sync,hard" } 
#    - { server_ip: 198.168.0.1, server_share_path: "/mnt/share2", client_share_path: "/mnt/mount2", client_mount_options: "nosuid,rw,sync,hard" } 
# Example for multiple mount file system:
# nfs_client_params: 
# - { server_ip: 198.168.0.1, server_share_path: "/mnt/share1", client_share_path: "/mnt/mount1", client_mount_options: "nosuid,rw,sync,hard" } 
# - { server_ip: 198.168.0.2, server_share_path: "/mnt/share2", client_share_path: "/mnt/mount2", client_mount_options: "nosuid,rw,sync,hard" }
