# -----------------------------NFS------------------------------------------------

# USER have to mount EXTERNAL NFS server, omnia will mount NFS client when nfs_server value is false.
# omnia will setup NFS server and mount NFS client when nfs_server value is true.
# This variable is used for creating NFS share on slurm_control_node, slurm_node, kube_control_plane, kube_node, auth_server, login, etcd nodes
# Values should be entered in JSON format only.
# If mount_option values are empty, NFS client will be mounted with these values "nosuid,rw,sync,hard,intr"
# Its mandatory to provide atleast one entry in nfs_client_params
# If user wants to setup NFS server on control plane "localhost" can be mentioned as server_ip or admin_nic_ip of control plane also can be provided.
# For the server which must be used as k8s server share for NFS external provisioner must be given k8s_share as true
# For the server which must be used as slurm share, slurm_share must be given as true
# For benchmarks, either slurm_share or k8s_share will be used. Higher precedence will be given to slurm_share
# Example for single mount file system:
# nfs_client_params: 
# - { server_ip: 10.5.0.101, server_share_path: "/mnt/share", client_share_path: "/home", client_mount_options: "nosuid,rw,sync,hard", nfs_server: true, slurm_share: true, k8s_share: true }
# Example for supporting multiple mount points:
# nfs_client_params: 
#    - { server_ip: localhost, server_share_path: "/mnt/share1", client_share_path: "/home", client_mount_options: "nosuid,rw,sync,hard", nfs_server: true, slurm_share: false, k8s_share: true } 
#    - { server_ip: 198.168.0.1, server_share_path: "/mnt/share2", client_share_path: "/mnt/mount2", client_mount_options: "nosuid,rw,sync,hard", nfs_server: false, slurm_share: true, k8s_share: true}
# Example for multiple mount file system:
# nfs_client_params: 
# - { server_ip: 198.168.0.1, server_share_path: "/mnt/share1", client_share_path: "/mnt/mount1", client_mount_options: "nosuid,rw,sync,hard", nfs_server: false , slurm_share: false, k8s_share: true} 
# - { server_ip: 198.168.0.2, server_share_path: "/mnt/share2", client_share_path: "/mnt/mount2", client_mount_options: "nosuid,rw,sync,hard", nfs_server: false , slurm_share: true, k8s_share: false} 
nfs_client_params:
   - { server_ip: localhost, server_share_path: /mnt/omnia_home_share, client_share_path: /home, client_mount_options: "nosuid,rw,sync,hard,intr", nfs_server: true, slurm_share: true, k8s_share: true }


# ----------------------------BEEGFS---------------------------------------------------

# This variable is used if user has RDMA-capable network hardware (e.g., InfiniBand)
# Accepted values: true or false
# Default value: false
# To enable support for remote direct memory access (RDMA), set this value to true
beegfs_rdma_support: false

# This variable if there are separate OFED kernel modules installed
# Add path for kernel module
# Default value is "/usr/src/ofa_kernel/default/include"
# Please make sure this path is present on your nodes, else give appropriate path before execution
beegfs_ofed_kernel_modules_path: "/usr/src/ofa_kernel/default/include"

# This variable is used for taking BeeGFS management server IP
# Provide IP of beegfs management server
# Required field
beegfs_mgmt_server: ""

# Beegfs-client file system mount location
# Default value is "/mnt/beegfs"
# Make sure beegfs_unmount_client value is true, for changing BeeGFS mounts location
beegfs_mounts: "/mnt/beegfs"

# The value of beegfs_unmount_client should be true, if there is a change in beegfs_mounts value or beegfs_client_version
# Accepted values: true or false
# Default value: false
# changing this value to true will unmount running instance of BeeGFS client
beegfs_unmount_client: false

# For installing different version of BeeGFS client than the version which is already running on the BeeGFS cluster
# Accepted values: true or false
# Default value: false
# If there is a need for installing different version of BeeGFS client then make this variable to true
beegfs_version_change: false

# Beegfs secret storage file or authentication file
# Required for Beegfs version >= 7.2.7
# Default value is /home/connauthfile
# Accepted value: Path along with filename for secret stoarge file configured
# on beegfs server
# If this is not provided, beegfs installation will fail
beegfs_secret_storage_filepath: "/home/connauthfile"
