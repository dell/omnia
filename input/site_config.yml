# Proxy configuration for the Omnia Infrastructure Manager if it is behind a proxy environment for internet access
# If proxy details are not provided, Omnia assumes direct internet connectivity is available to the Omnia Infrastructure Manager
# The values for http_proxy and https_proxy in the proxy variable should be set as environment variables http_proxy and https_proxy in the Omnia Infrastructure Manager.
# The no_proxy environment variable should include the Omnia Infrastructure Manager hostname and the admin network IP address.
# Example of providing proxy details:
# proxy:
#   - { http_proxy: "http://corporate-proxy:3128", https_proxy: "http://corporate-proxy:3128", no_proxy: "" }
#
proxy:
   - { http_proxy: "", https_proxy: "", no_proxy: "" }
