# Optional
# This variable accepts the repository urls of the user which contains the packages required for the cluster.
# always: In this case, Omnia creates a local repo on the Omnia Infrastructure Manager hosting all the packages required for the cluster.
# User should make sure required disk space is available.
# partial: In this case, Omnia creates a local repo on the Omnia Infrastructure Manager hosting packages not part of user's repository.
# never: In this case, Omnia does not create a local repo. All the packages are directly downloaded on the cluster.
# This variable accepts repo url and gpgkey
# url: defines the baseurl for the repository
# gpgkey: defines gpgkey for the repository
# If gpgkey is empty then gpgcheck will be disabled for that repository
# This variable should not have jinja variables in it.
# In Ubuntu OS, it is mandatory to provide gpgkey for the user repositories. In case there is no gpgkey associated with the repo
# and user leaves the gpgkey field empty (gpgkey: "" ), omnia configures the repository as a trusted source and the user is solely
# responsible in maintaining the security.
# Example:
# user_repo_url:
#   - {url: "http://user_repo.com/x86_64/os/",gpgkey: "http://user_repo.com/x86_64/os/RPM-GPG-KEY"}
user_repo_url:

# Optional
# This variable accepts the registry url along with port of the user which contains the images required for cluster.
# always: In this case, Omnia creates a local registry on the Omnia Infrastructure Manager hosting all the images required for the cluster.
# User should make sure required disk space is available.
# partial: In this case, Omnia creates a local registry on the Omnia Infrastructure Manager hosting images not part of user's registry.
# never: In this case, Omnia does not create a local registry. All the images are directly downloaded on the cluster.
# This variable accepts host and cert_path
# host: defines the url and port for registry
# cert_path: defines the absolute path of the certificates for each registry.
# If cert_path is empty, insecure registry will be configured.
# Example:
# user_registry:
#   - { host: 10.11.0.100:5001, cert_path: "/home/ca.crt" }
#   - { host: registryhostname.registry.test, cert_path: "" }
user_registry:

# Mandatory when cluster_os_type is ubuntu in softwares_config.json
# This variable will be ignored when cluster_os_type is rhel or rocky
# This variables defines the repos to be configured on all the compute nodes
# When repo_config is always, partial or never, the given ubuntu_os_url configured via proxy in compute nodes
# Online ubuntu_os_url for Ubuntu 22.04 or 24.04 is http://in.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu
# Online ubuntu_os_url for Ubuntu 20.04 is http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu
# Example:
# When cluster_os_type is Ubuntu 22.04
# ubuntu_os_url: "http://in.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu"
ubuntu_os_url:

# Mandatory when cluster_os_type is rhel in softwares_config.json
# This variable will be ignored when cluster_os_type is ubuntu or rocky
# User has to provide the code ready builder url that should not have a RedHat subscription authentication inorder to download the packages
# When repo_config is always, the given rhel_os_url will be configured in the Omnia Infrastructure Manager and packages required  for cluster will be downloaded
# When repo_config is partial or never, the packages required for cluster which were coming from rhel_repo_url will not be downloaded.
# and the rhel_os_url configured via proxy in compute nodes
# Example:
# rhel_os_url:
#   - {url: "http://crb.com/CRB/x86_64/os/", gpgkey: "http://crb.com/CRB/x86_64/os/RPM-GPG-KEY", name: "codeready-builder"}
