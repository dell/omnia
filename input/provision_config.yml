#### PXE provisioned nodes information source
## PXE mapping file path details
# The mapping file consists of the MAC address and its respective IP address and Hostname.
# If user wants to assign static IPs, format of csv: MAC,Hostname,IP
# Only last 16 bits/2 octets of IPv4 can be dynamic
# Ensure that IPs given in mapping file goes hand in hand with the pxe_nic ranges provided above
# Ex. xx:yy:zz:aa:bb:cc,server,172.17.0.5
# A templates for mapping file exists in omnia/examples and is named as pxe_mapping_file.csv
# This depicts the path where user has kept the mapping file for DHCP configurations.

# The prefix for the node names, if needed to be dynamically allocated.
# Hostname = node_name + '0000x' + domain_name
# Hostname should be less than 65 characters.
