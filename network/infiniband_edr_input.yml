  # ----Switch-IB(TM) 2 based EDR InfiniBand 1U Switch, 36 QSFP28 ports----
# Change the configurations as per the switch model to avoid failures

# Subnet Manager: centralized resource used by infiniband
# to handle the management of the fabric.
# Cache and Log directories of subnet manager
# container are mounted to below mentioned path on host.

# cache_directory: opensm stores certain data to the disk such that
# subsequent runs are consistent. The default directory used is /var/cache/opensm.
# The following files are included in it: guid2lid, guid2mkey, neighbors

# log_directory: controls the directory in which the temporary files
# generated by opensm are created. These files are: opensm-subnet.lst,
# opensm.fdbs, and opensm.log. By default, this directory is /var/log.

# This variable is used for enabling split port functionality on IB switch
# Accepted values are true or false
# Default value is false 
enable_split_port: false

# This variable is used for taking list of ports to be splitted
# Mandatory field when enable_split_port value is true
# Values should be entered in comma seperated format. Ex: "1,2"
# Values can be entered in range format. Ex: "1-10"
# Values can be in the combination of both formats. Ex: "1,2,3-8,9,10-12"
