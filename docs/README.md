**Omnia** (Latin: all or everything) is a deployment tool to configure Dell EMC PowerEdge servers running standard RPM-based Linux OS images into clusters capable of supporting HPC, AI, and data analytics workloads. It uses Slurm, Kubernetes, and other packages to manage jobs and run diverse workloads on the same converged solution. It is a collection of [Ansible](https://ansible.org) playbooks, is open source, and is constantly being extended to enable comprehensive workloads.

## What Omnia does
Omnia can build clusters which use Slurm or Kubernetes (or both!) for workload management. Omnia will install software from a variety of sources, including:
- Standard CentOS and [ELRepo](http://elrepo.org) repositories
- Helm repositories
- Source code compilation
- [OpenHPC](https://openhpc.community) repositories (_coming soon!_)
- [OperatorHub](https://operatorhub.io) (_coming soon!_)

Whenever possible, Omnia will leverage existing projects rather than reinvent the wheel.

### Omnia stacks
Omnia can install Kubernetes or Slurm (or both), along with additional drivers, services, libraries, and user applications.

## Deploying clusters using the Omnia Appliance
The Omnia Appliance will automate the entire cluster deployment process, starting with provisioning the operating system to servers.

Ensure all the prerequisites listed in [preparation to install Omnia Appliance](PREINSTALL_OMNIA_APPLIANCE.md) are met before installing the Omnia appliance.

For detailed instructions on installing the Omnia appliance, see [Install Omnia Appliance](INSTALL_OMNIA_APPLIANCE.md).

## Installing Omnia to servers with a pre-provisioned OS
Omnia can be deploy clusters to servers that already have an RPM-based Linux OS running on them, and are all connected to the Internet. Currently all Omnia testing is done on [CentOS](https://centos.org). Please see [Preparation to install Omnia](PREINSTALL_OMNIA.md) for instructions on network setup.

Once servers have functioning OS and networking, you can use Omnia to install and start Slurm and/or Kubernetes. Please see [Install Omnia using CLI](INSTALL_OMNIA.md) for detailed instructions.

# Known issue  
Issue: Hosts do not display on the AWX UI.  
	
Resolution:  
* Verify if `provisioned_hosts.yml` is present in the `omnia/appliance/roles/inventory/files` folder.
* Verify if hosts are not listed in the `provisioned_hosts.yml` file. If hosts are not listed, then servers are not PXE booted yet.
* If hosts are listed in the `provisioned_hosts.yml` file, then an IP address has been assigned to them by DHCP. However, hosts are not displayed on the AWX UI as the PXE boot is still in process or is not initiated.
* Check for the reachable and unreachable hosts using the `provisioned_report.yml` tool present in the `omnia/appliance/tools` folder. To run provisioned_report.yml, in the omnia/appliance directory, run `playbook -i roles/inventory/files/provisioned_hosts.yml tools/provisioned_report.yml`.

# [Frequently asked questions](FAQ.md)

# Limitations
1. Removal of Slurm and Kubernetes component roles are not supported. However, skip tags can be provided at the start of installation to select the component roles.​
2. After the installation of the Omnia appliance, changing the manager node is not supported. If you need to change the manager node, you must redeploy the entire cluster.  
3. Dell Technologies provides support to the Dell developed modules of Omnia. All the other third-party tools deployed by Omnia are outside the support scope.​
4. To change the Kubernetes single node cluster to a multi-node cluster or to change a multi-node cluster to a single node cluster, you must either redeploy the entire cluster or run `kubeadm reset -f` on all the nodes of the cluster. You then need to run `omnia.yml` file and skip the installation of Slurm using the skip tags.
# Contributing to Omnia
The Omnia project was started to give members of the [Dell Technologies HPC Community](https://dellhpc.org) a way to easily setup clusters of Dell EMC servers, and to contribute useful tools, fixes, and functionality back to the HPC Community.

# Open to All
