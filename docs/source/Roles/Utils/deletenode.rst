Remove node from the cluster
----------------------------
Use this playbook to remove nodes from the cluster and stop all clustering software on the target nodes. `here. <../../samplefiles.html#inventory-file>`_

.. note:: All target nodes should be drained before executing the playbook. If a job is running on any target nodes, the playbook will exit.

**Configurations performed by the playbook**

    * Remove node from Slurm and Kubernetes cluster.
    * Update Slurm and Kubernetes config.
    * Slurm and Kubernetes services are stopped (not uninstalled). OS startup service list will be updated to disable Slurm and Kubernetes.

**To run the playbook**

Run the playbook using the following commands: ::

        cd utils
        ansible-playbook remove_node_config.yml -i inventory


Soft reset the cluster
-----------------------
Use this playbook to stop all Slurm and Kubernetes services. This action will destroy the cluster. See the sample inventory file `here. <../../samplefiles.html#inventory-file>`_

.. note:: All target nodes should be drained before executing the playbook. If a job is running on any target nodes, the playbook will exit.

**Configurations performed by the playbook**

    * The Slurm or Kubernetes cluster will be reset.
    * The configuration on the kube_control_plane or the slurm_control_plane will be reset.
    * Slurm and Kubernetes services are stopped (not uninstalled).

**To run the playbook**

Run the playbook using the following commands: ::

        cd utils
        ansible-playbook reset_cluster_config.yml -i inventory

Delete node from the cluster
-----------------------------
Use this playbook to remove nodes from all inventory files and tables. No changes are made to the Slurm or Kubernetes cluster. See the sample inventory file `here. <../../samplefiles.html#inventory-file-to-delete-node-from-the-cluster>`_

.. note:: All target nodes should be drained before executing the playbook. If a job is running on any target nodes, the playbook will exit.

**Configurations performed by the playbook**

    * Nodes will be deleted from the Omnia DB and xCAT node object will be deleted.
    * Telemetry services will be stopped.

**To run the playbook**

Run the playbook using the following commands: ::

        cd utils
        ansible-playbook delete_node.yml -i inventory


.. note:: When the node is added or deleted, the autogenerated inventories: ``amd_gpu``, ``nvidia_gpu``, ``amd_cpu``, and ``intel_cpu`` should be updated for the latest changes. Slurm partition is also needs to be updated with these changes.
