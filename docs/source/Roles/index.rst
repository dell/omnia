Roles
=============

From Omnia 1.4, all of Omnia's many features are available via collections. Collections allow users to to choose different features and customize their deployment journey individual to their needs. Alternatively, all features can be invoked using the two top level scripts:

1. `provision.yml <../InstallationGuides/InstallingProvisionTool/index.html>`_

2. `omnia.yml <../InstallationGuides/BuildingClusters/index.html>`_
