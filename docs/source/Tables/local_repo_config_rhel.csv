Parameter,Details
"**repo_store_path**

``string``

Required","* The intended file path for offline repository data.
* Ensure the disk partition has enough space.
* Ensure that 755 permission is given to ``repo_store_path`` if user intends to use nfs share mount for ``repo_store_path``. 

**Default value**:  ``""/opt/omnia_repo""``"
"**user_repo_url**

``JSON List``

Optional","* This variable accepts the repository urls of the user which contains the packages required for the cluster.

* When ``repo_config`` is always, the given list will be configured on the OIM and packages required for cluster will be downloaded into a local repository.

* When ``repo_config`` is partial, a local repository is created on the OIM containing packages that are not part of the user's repository.

* When ``repo_config`` is never, no local repository is created and packages are downloaded on all cluster nodes.

* 'url' defines the baseurl for the repository.

* 'gpgkey' defines gpgkey for the repository. If 'gpgkey' is omitted then   gpgcheck=0 is set for that repository.

* **Sample value**: ``- {url: ""http://crb.com/CRB/x86_64/os/"",gpgkey: ""http://crb.com/CRB/x86_64/os/RPM-GPG-KEY""}``"
"**user_registry**

``JSON List``

Optional","* This variable accepts the registry url along with port of the user which contains the images required for cluster.

* When ``repo_config`` is always, the list given in ``user_registry`` will be configured on the OIM and packages required for cluster will be downloaded into a local repository. If the same repository is available in both the ``user_repo_url`` and the ``user_registry``, the repository will be configured using the values in ``user_registry``.

* When ``repo_config`` is partial, a local registry is created on the OIM containing packages that are not part of the ``user_registry``. Images listed in ``user_registry`` are directly configured as a mirror on compute nodes. Compute nodes are expected to connect to the URLs in the ``user_registry`` via http_proxy.

* When ``repo_config`` is never, no local registry is created and packages/images are downloaded on all cluster nodes.

* 'host' defines the URL and path to the registry.

* 'cert_path' defines the absolute path where the security certificates for each registry. If this path is not provided, insecure registries are configured.

* **Sample value**: ::

   - { host: 10.11.0.100:5001, cert_path: ""/home/ca.crt"" }
   - { host: registryhostname.registry.test, cert_path: """" }"
"**rhel_os_url**

``string``

Required","* Mandatory when ``cluster_os_type`` is rhel in ``softwares_config.json``.
* User has to provide the code ready builder url in order to download the packages.
* When ``repo_config`` is ""always"", the given ``rhel_os_url`` will be configured in the OIM and packages required for cluster will be downloaded.
* When repo_config is ""partial"" or ""never"", the packages required for cluster which were coming from ``rhel_repo_url`` will not be downloaded.
* The ``rhel_os_url`` is configured via proxy in compute nodes.

* **Example**: If ``cluster_os_type`` is rhel, ``rhel_os_url`` might be ""- {url: ""http://crb.com/CRB/x86_64/os/"", gpgkey: ""http://crb.com/CRB/x86_64/os/RPM-GPG-KEY""}""

.. caution:: Omnia does not support adding a Red Hat subscription URL to the ``rhel_os_url`` parameter. Adding it results in an error during ``local_repo.yml`` playbook execution. For more information, `click here <../../../Troubleshooting/KnownIssues/RHEL/local_repo.html>`_."
"**omnia_repo_url_rhel**

``JSON List``

Required","* A list of all the repo urls from where rpms will be downloaded for Omnia features on RHEL clusters.
* 'url' defines the baseurl for the repository.
* 'gpgkey' defines gpgkey for the repository. If 'gpgkey' is omitted, then gpgcheck=0 is set for that repository
* This value is not validated by Omnia. Any errors can cause Omnia to fail.
* Ensure that all URLs listed below are reachable to the OIM.

**Default value**: ::

       - { url: ""https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/$releasever/$basearch/stable"", gpgkey: ""https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/gpg"" }
