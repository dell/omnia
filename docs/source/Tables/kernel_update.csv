* This variable contains the list of software group mentioned in ``software_config.json``.                                                                                                   
* Example: ::

    softwares_list: 
     - custom 


* In the above case, user is required to create custom.json under ``input/config/<cluster_os_type>/<cluster_os_version>/custom.json``. For example: ``input/config/ubuntu/22.04/custom.json``
* This json should list the kernel packages to be downloaded during ``local_repo.yml`` execution, and for installation as part of ``software_update.yml`` execution. Kernel package name of Ubuntu is ``linux-generic``, whereas for RHEL or Rocky, it's just ``kernel*``. For example:

    {
    ""custom"": {
        ""cluster"": [
            {
                ""package"": ""linux-generic"",
                ""type"": ""deb"",
                ""repo_name"": ""jammy""
