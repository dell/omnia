A virtual disk may not have been created,Create a virtual disk and PXE boot the node.
Re-run of the ``discovery_provision.yml`` playbook on the control plane while provisioning is in-progress on the remote nodes.,Initiate PXE boot on the remote node after completion of the ``discovery_provision.yml`` playbook execution.
