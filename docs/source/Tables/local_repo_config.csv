Parameter,Details
"**repo_store_path**

``string``

Required","* The intended file path for offline repository data.
* Ensure the disk partition has enough space. 

**Default value**:  ``""/omnia_repo""``"
"**user_repo_url**

``JSON List``

Optional","* This variable accepts the repository urls of the user which contains the packages required for the cluster.

* When ``repo_config`` is always, the given list will be configured on the control plane and packages required for cluster will be downloaded into a local repository.

* When ``repo_config`` is partial, a local repository is created on the control plane containing packages that are not part of the user's repository.

* When ``repo_config`` is never, no local repository is created and packages are downloaded on all cluster nodes.

* 'url' defines the baseurl for the repository.

* 'gpgkey' defines gpgkey for the repository. If 'gpgkey' is omitted then   gpgcheck=0 is set for that repository.

* **Sample value**: ``- {url: ""http://crb.com/CRB/x86_64/os/"",gpgkey: ""http://crb.com/CRB/x86_64/os/RPM-GPG-KEY""}``


"
"**user_registry**

``JSON List``

Optional","* This variable accepts the registry url along with port of the user which contains the images required for cluster.

* When ``repo_config`` is always, the list given in ``user_registry`` will be configured on the control plane and packages required for cluster will be downloaded into a local repository. If the same repository is available in both the ``user_repo_url`` and the ``user_registry``, the repository will be configured using the values in ``user_registry``.

* When ``repo_config`` is partial, a local registry is created on the control plane containing packages that are not part of the ``user_registry``. Images listed in ``user_registry`` are directly configured as a mirror on compute nodes. Compute nodes are expected to connect to the URLs in the ``user_registry`` via http_proxy.

* When ``repo_config`` is never, no local registry is created and packages/images are downloaded on all cluster nodes.

* 'host' defines the URL and path to the registry.

* 'cert_path' defines the absolute path where the security certificates for each registry. If this path is not provided, insecure registries are configured.

* **Sample value**: ::

   - { host: 10.11.0.100:5001, cert_path: ""/home/ca.crt"" }
   - { host: registryhostname.registry.test, cert_path: """" }







"
"**os_repo_url**

``string``

Optional","* URL to a list of repositories to be configured for Ubuntu clusters. This value is required on Ubuntu clusters but ignored when the cluster runs RHEL or Rocky.
* When the value of ``repo_config`` in ``input/local_repo_config.yml`` is set to ``always``, the given ``os_repo_url`` will be mirrored on the control plane.
* When the value of ``repo_config`` in ``input/local_repo_config.yml`` is set to ``partial`` or ``never``, the given ``os_repo_url`` is configured via proxy on the compute nodes.

* **Sample value**: ``http://in.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu``"
"**omnia_repo_url_rhel**

``JSON List``

Required","* A list of all the repo urls from where rpms will be downloaded for Omnia features on RHEL clusters.
* 'url' defines the baseurl for the repository.
* 'gpgkey' defines gpgkey for the repository. If 'gpgkey' is omitted, then gpgcheck=0 is set for that repository
* This value is not validated by Omnia. Any errors can cause Omnia to fail.
* Ensure that all URLs listed below are reachable to the control plane.
