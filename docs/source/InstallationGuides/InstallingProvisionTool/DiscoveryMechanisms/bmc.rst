bmc
---

For automatic provisioning of servers and discovery, the BMC method can be used.

**Pre requisites**

- The control plane NIC connected to remote servers (through the switch) should be configured with two IPs in a shared LOM set up. This NIC is configured by Omnia with the IP xx.yy.255.254, aa.bb.255.254 (where xx.yy are taken from ``bmc_nic_subnet`` and aa.bb are taken from ``admin_nic_subnet``) when ``discovery_mechanism`` is set to ``bmc``.

- IP ranges (``bmc_static_start_range``, ``bmc_static_start_range``) provided to Omnia for BMC discovery should be within the same subnet.

.. note:: To create a meaningful range of discovery, ensure that the last two octets of   ``bmc_static_end_range`` are equal to or greater than the last two octets of   the ``bmc_static_start_range``. That is, for the range a.b.c.d - a.b.e.f, e   and f should be greater than or equal to c and d. *Ex: 172.20.0.50 -   172.20.1.101 is a valid range however,    172.20.0.101 - 172.20.1.50 is not.*

- All iDRACs should be reachable from the ``admin_nic``.

.. note::
    *When iDRACs are in DHCP mode**
        *  The IP range *x.y.246.1* - *x.y.255.253* (where x and y are provided by the first two octets of ``bmc_nic_subnet``) are reserved by Omnia.
        * *x.y.246.1* - *x.y.250.253* will be the range of IPs reserved for dynamic assignment by Omnia.
        * During provisioning, Omnia updates servers to static mode and assigns IPs from *x.y.251.1* - *x.y.255.253*.
        * Users can see the IPs (that have been assigned from *x.y.251.1* - *x.y.255.253*) in the DB after provisioning the servers.
        * For example:
            If the provided ``bmc_subnet`` is ``10.3.0.0`` and there are two iDRACs in DHCP mode, the IPs assigned will be ``10.3.251.1`` and ``10.3.251.2``.

The following parameters need to be populated in ``input/provision_config.yml`` to discover target nodes using BMC.

.. note::

    The ``input/provision_config.yml`` file is encrypted on the first run of the provision tool:
        To view the encrypted parameters: ::

            ansible-vault view provision_config.yml --vault-password-file .provision_vault_key

        To edit the encrypted parameters: ::

            ansible-vault edit provision_config.yml --vault-password-file .provision_vault_key




.. warning:: The IP address *192.168.25.x* is used for PowerVault Storage communications. Therefore, do not use this IP address for other configurations.
