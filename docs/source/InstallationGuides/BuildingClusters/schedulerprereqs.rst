Before you build clusters
--------------------------

* `Ensure that all cluster nodes are up and running <../InstallingProvisionTool/ViewingDB.html>`_.

* Verify that all inventory files are updated.

* If the cluster requires more than 10 kubernetes nodes, use a docker enterprise account to avoid docker pull limits.

* Verify that all nodes are assigned a group. Use the `inventory <../../samplefiles.html>`_ as a reference. The inventory file is case-sensitive. Follow the casing provided in the sample file link.

* If `NFS <NFS.html>`_ or `BeeGFS <BeeGFS.html>`_ are required on the cluster, run ``storage.yml``.

.. note::
    * The inventory file accepts both IPs and FQDNs as long as they can be resolved by DNS.
    * In a multi-node setup, IP's cannot be listed as a control plane and a  cluster node. That is, don't include the kube_control_plane IP address in the compute group. In a single node setup, the compute node and the kube_control_plane must be the same.

* Users should also ensure that all repos are available on the cluster nodes running RHEL.
