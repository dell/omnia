Running local repo
------------------

The local repository feature will help create offline repositories on the control plane which all the cluster nodes will access.

**Configurations made by the playbook**

    * A registry is created on the control plane at <Control Plane hostname>:5001.

    * If ``repo_config`` in ``local_repo_config.yml`` is set to ``always`` or ``partial``, all images present in the ``input/config/<operating system>/<version>`` folder will be downloaded to the control plane.


        * If the image is defined using a tag, the image will be tagged using <control plane hostname>:5001/<image_name>:<version> and pushed to the Omnia local registry.

        * If the image is defined using a digest, the image will be tagged using <control plane hostname>:5001/<image_name>:omnia and pushed to the Omnia local registry.repositories


    * When  ``repo_config`` in ``local_repo_config.yml`` is set to ``always``, the control plane is set as the default registry mirror.

    * When ``repo_config`` in ``local_repo_config`` is set to ``partial``, the ``user_registry`` (if defined) and the control plane are set as default registry mirrors.

To create local repositories, run the following commands: ::

    cd local_repo
    ansible-playbook local_repo.yml

Verify changes made by the playbook by running ``cat /etc/containerd/certs.d/_default/hosts.toml`` on compute nodes.

To fetch images from the ``user_registry`` or the Omnia local registry, run the below commands:

    * Images defined with versions: ``nerdctl pull <global_registry>/<image_name>:<tag>``
    * Images defined with digests: ``nerdctl pull <global_registry>/<image_name>:omnia``

.. note::


    * After ``local_repo.yml`` has run, the value of ``repo_config`` in ``input/software_config.json`` cannot be updated without running the `control_plane_cleanup.yml <../CleanUpScript.html>`_ script first.

    * For images coming from ``gcr.io``, digests are defined as tags are not available. Omnia gives a custom tag of ‘omnia’ to these images. If such images need to be taken from the ``user_registry``, use one of the below steps:

        * Append 'omnia' to the end of the image name while pushing images to the ``user_registry``. Update the image definition in ``input/config/<operating system>/<version>/<software>.json`` to follow the same nomenclature.

        * If a different tag is provided, update the digest value in ``input/config/<operating system>/<version>/<software>.json`` as per the image digest in the ``user_directory``. To get the updated digest from the ``user_registry``, use the below steps:

            * Check the tag of image: ``curl -k https://<user_registry>/v2/<image_name>/tags/list``

            * Check the digest of the tag: ``curl -H <headers> -k https://<user_registry>/v2/<image_name>/manifests/omnia``


**Update local repositories**

This playbook updates all local repositories configured on a provisioned cluster after local repositories have been configured.

To run the playbook: ::

    cd utils
    ansible-playbook update_user_repo.yml -i inventory
