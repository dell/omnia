For the security guidelines of Ansible modules, go to `Developing Modules Best Practices: Module Security <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/dev_guide/developing_modules_best_practices.html#module-security>`_.

Ansible vault
-------------

Ansible vault enables encryption of variables and files to protect sensitive content such as passwords or keys rather than leaving it visible as plaintext in playbooks or roles. Please refer `Ansible Vault guidelines <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/vault_guide/index.html>`_ for more information.
