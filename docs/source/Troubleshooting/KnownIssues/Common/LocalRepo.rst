Local Repositories
===================

⦾ **Why does running** ``local_repo.yml`` **fail with connectivity errors?**

**Potential Cause**: The OIM was unable to reach a required online resource due to a network glitch.

**Resolution**: Verify all connectivity and re-run the playbook.


⦾ **Why does any script that installs software fail with** ``The checksum for <software repository path> did not match.`` **error?**

**Potential Cause**: A local repository for the software has not been configured by the ``local_repo.yml`` playbook.

**Resolution**: Follow the steps below to resolve this issue:

    1. Re-run the ``local_repo.yml`` playbook with proper inputs to download the software package to the Pulp repository.
    2. Once the local repository has been configured successfully, re-run the failed installation script.


⦾ **The**  ``local_repo.yml`` **playbook execution fails if the Epel repository is unstable.**

**Potential Cause**: If the external Epel repository link mentioned in ``omnia_repo_url_rhel`` is not stable, then it can cause failures in ``local_repo.yml`` playbook execution.

**Resolution**:

1. Check if the Epel repository link mentioned in ``omnia_repo_url_rhel`` is accessible.

2. Verify the required software listed in ``software_config.json``, by examining the corresponding ``<software>.json`` files located in the ``input/config/rhel/`` directory. User can do either of the following, based on the findings:

    - If none of the packages are dependent on the Epel repository, users can remove the Epel repository URL from ``omnia_repo_url_rhel``.

    - If any package required from the Epel repository is listed in the ``software_config.json`` file, it's advisable to either wait for the Epel repository to stabilize or host those Epel repository packages locally. Afterward, remove the Epel repository link from ``omnia_repo_url_rhel`` and provide the locally hosted URL for the Epel repository packages via the ``user_repo_url`` variable.
