General Query
==============

⦾ **Why does the task 'Gather facts from all the nodes' get stuck when re-running omnia.yml?**

**Potential Cause**: Corrupted entries in the ``/root/.ansible/cp/`` folder. For more information on this issue, `check this out <https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/17349>`_!

**Resolution**: Clear the directory ``/root/.ansible/cp/`` using the following commands: ::

    cd /root/.ansible/cp/

    rm -rf *

Alternatively, run the task manually: ::

    cd omnia/utils/cluster
    ansible-playbook gather_facts_resolution.yml
