Local Repository
===================

⦾ **local_repo.yml playbook execution fails at the TASK [parse_and_download : Display Failed Packages]**

.. image:: ../../../images/package_failure_local_repo.png

**Potential Cause**: This issue is encountered if Omnia fails to download any software package while executing ``local_repo.yml`` playbook. Download failures can occur if:

    * The URL to download the software packages mentioned in the ``<cluster_os_type>/<cluster_os_version>/<software>.json`` is incorrect or the repository is unreachable.
    * The provided Docker credentials are incorrect or if you encounter a Docker pull limit issue. For more information, `click here <https://www.docker.com/increase-rate-limits/#:~:text=You%20have%20reached%20your%20pull%20rate%20limit.%20You,account%20to%20a%20Docker%20Pro%20or%20Team%20subscription.>`_.
    * If the disk space is insufficient while downloading the package.

**Resolution**: Re-run the ``local_repo.yml`` playbook while ensuring the following:

    * URL to download the software packages mentioned in ``<cluster_os_type>/<cluster_os_version>/<software>.json`` is correct, and the repository is reachable.
    * Docker credentials provided in ``input/provision_config_credentials`` is correct.
    * Sufficient disk space is available while downloading the package. For disk space considerations, see the `Omnia installation guide <../../../OmniaInstallGuide/index.html>`_.

If the ``local_repo.yml`` is executed successfully without any package download failures, a "success" message is displayed as shown below:
