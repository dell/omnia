# Enabling Security on the Login Node 

>> __Note:__ For 389ds/SSSD to work, an external LDAP server has to be set up in your environment as Omnia does not configure LDAP.

## Prerequisites Before Enabling Security:

* Verify that the login node host name has been set. If not, use the following steps to set it.
	* Set hostname of the login node to hostname.domainname format using the below command:
	`hostnamectl set-hostname <hostname>.<domainname>`
	>>Eg: `hostnamectl set-hostname login-node.omnia.test`
	* Add the set hostname in `/etc/hosts` using vi editor.

	`vi /etc/hosts`

    * Add the IP of the login node with the above hostname using `hostnamectl` command in last line of the file.
  
	__Eg:__  xx.xx.xx.xx <hostname>
	
>> __Note:__ 
>>	* The Hostname should not contain the following characters: , (comma), \. (period) or _ (underscore). However, the **domain name** is allowed commas and periods. 
>>	* The Hostname cannot start or end with a hyphen (-).
>>	* No upper case characters are allowed in the hostname.
>>	* The hostname cannot start with a number.

* Set the following parameters in `omnia_security_config.yml`

* Ensure that `enable_secure_login_node` is set to **true** in `omnia_config.yml`

## Limiting User Authentication over sshd

Users logging into this host will can be __optionally__ allowed or denied using an access control list. All users to be allowed or denied are to be listed in the variable `user` in `security_vars.yml`. 

>> __Note:__ All users on the server will have to be defined manually. Omnia does not create any users by default.

## Session Timeout

To encourage security, users who have been idle over 3 minutes will be logged out automatically. To adjust this value, update the `session_timeout` variable in `security_vars.yml`. This variable is mandatory. 

## Restricting Program Support

Optionally, different communication protocols can be disabled on the management station using the `restrict_program_support` and `restrict_softwares` variables. These protocols include: telnet,lpd,bluetooth,rlogin and rexec. Features that cannot be disabled include: ftp,smbd,nmbd,automount and portmap. 


## Kernel Lockdown

* RockyOS has Kernel Lockdown mode (Integrity) enabled by default
* SUSE/Leap allows users to set Kernel Lockdown mode to Confidentiality or Integrity.
