# Enabling Security on the Management Station

Omnia uses [FreeIPA (on RockyOS)](https://www.freeipa.org/page/Documentation
) and [389ds(on Leap)](https://doc.opensuse.org/documentation/leap/security/html/book-security/cha-security-ldap.html
) to enable security features like authorisation and access control.

>> __Note:__ For 389ds/SSSD to work, an external LDAP server has to be set up in your environment as Omnia does not configure LDAP.

## Enabling Authentication on the Management Station:

Set the parameter 'enable_security_support' to true in `base_vars.yml`

## Prerequisites Before Enabling Security:

* Set hostname of management station to hostname.domainname format using the below command:
`hostnamectl set-hostname <hostname>.<domainname>`
>>Eg: `hostnamectl set-hostname valdiationms.omnia.test`
>> __Note:__ 
>>	* The Hostname should not contain the following characters: , (comma), \. (period) or _ (underscore). However, the **domain name** is allowed commas and periods. 
>>	* The Hostname cannot start or end with a hyphen (-).
>>	* No upper case characters are allowed in the hostname.
>>	* The hostname cannot start with a number.

* Add the set hostname in `/etc/hosts` using vi editor.

`vi /etc/hosts`

* Add the IP of the management station with the above hostname using `hostnamectl` command in last line of the file.
>> Eg: xx.xx.xx.xx <hostname>

* Enter the relevant values in `login_vars.yml`:

| ms_kerberos_admin_password         |               | "admin" user password for the IPA server on RockyOS. If LeapOS is in use, it is used as the "kerberos admin" user password for 389-ds                                                       |

>> __Note:__ In the event that `control_plane.yml` fails after executing the control plane security tasks, `sshd` services will have to be restarted manually by the User.

## Limiting User Authentication over sshd

Users logging into this host will can be __optionally__ allowed or denied using an access control list. All users to be allowed or denied are to be listed in the variable `user` in `security_vars.yml`. 

>> __Note:__ All users on the server will have to be defined manually. Omnia does not create any users by default.

## Session Timeout

To encourage security, users who have been idle over 3 minutes will be logged out automatically. To adjust this value, update the `session_timeout` variable in `security_vars.yml`. This variable is mandatory. 

## Restricting Program Support

Optionally, different communication protocols can be disabled on the management station using the `restrict_program_support` and `restrict_softwares` variables. These protocols include: telnet,lpd,bluetooth,rlogin and rexec. Features that cannot be disabled include: ftp,smbd,nmbd,automount and portmap. 

## Log Aggregation via Grafana

[Loki](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/fundamentals/overview/) is a datastore used to efficiently hold log data for security purposes. Using the `promtail` agent, logs are collated and streamed via a HTTP API.

>> __Note:__ When `control_plane.yml` is run, Loki is automatically set up as a data source on the Grafana UI.



### Querying Loki 

Loki uses basic regex based syntax to filter for specific jobs, dates or timestamps.

* Select the Explore ![Explore Icon](../Telemetry_Visualization/Images/ExploreIcon.PNG) tab to select control-plane-loki from the drop down.
* Using [LogQL queries](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/logql/log_queries/), all logs in `/var/log` can be accessed using filters (Eg: `{job=”Omnia”}` )

## Viewing Logs on the Dashboard

All log files can be viewed via the Dashboard tab (![Dashboard Icon](../Telemetry_Visualization/Images/DashBoardIcon.PNG)). The Default Dashboard displays `omnia.log` and `syslog`. Custom dashboards can be created per user requirements.

Below is a list of all logs available to Loki and can be accessed on the dashboard:
