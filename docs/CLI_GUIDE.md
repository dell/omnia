# Omnia Command Line Interface (CLI) Guide

## Enabling CLI on the control plane
To enable CLI on the control plane, disable AWX. This can be done by setting `awx_web_support` to `false` in `/ommia/control_plane/input_params/base_vars.yml`. If done before the initial run of `control_plane.yml`, Omnia will not install AWX on the control plane, thereby re-routing all other configuration via Ansible CLI.
>> **Note**: If `awx_web_support` is set to false on any subsequent runs of `control_plane.yml`, AWX will not be uninstalled. This will require user intervention. However, all configuration after `awx_web_support` is disabled will be via CLI.


## Running `control_plane.yml`
Assuming all [pre-requisites](PreRequisites/Control_Plane_PreReqs.md) are met and [input parameters](Input_Parameter_Guide) are entered, `control_plane.yml` script can only be invoked using CLI when AWX is disabled.
```
cd /omnia/control_plane
ansible-playbook control_plane.yml
```
>> **Note**: It is recommended that `control_plane.yml` is run from the control plane directory as explained above.

## Updating inventory
On executing Omnia control plane, all devices that can be managed by Omnia will be assigned an IP and device inventories will be created by device type in `/opt/omnia`. The inventories available are:
1. ethernet_inventory 
```
cat /opt/omnia/ethernet_inventory
172.17.0.108
```
2. infiniband_inventory 
```
cat /opt/omnia/infiniband_inventory
172.17.0.110
```
3. idrac_inventory 
```
cat /opt/omnia/idrac_inventory
172.19.0.100 service_tag=XXXXXXX model="PowerEdge R640"
172.19.0.101 service_tag=XXXXXXX model="PowerEdge R740"
172.19.0.103 service_tag=XXXXXXX model="PowerEdge C6420"
172.19.0.104 service_tag=XXXXXXX model="PowerEdge R7525"
```
4. provisioned_idrac_inventory 
```
cat /opt/omnia/provisioned_idrac_inventory
172.19.0.100 service_tag=XXXXXXX model="PowerEdge R640"
172.19.0.101 service_tag=XXXXXXX model="PowerEdge R740"
172.19.0.103 service_tag=XXXXXXX model="PowerEdge C6420"
172.19.0.104 service_tag=XXXXXXX model="PowerEdge R7525"
```
5. powervault_inventory 
```
cat /opt/omnia/powervault_inventory
172.17.0.109
```
6. node_inventory 
```
cat /opt/omnia/node_inventory
172.17.0.100 service_tag=XXXXXXX operating_system=RedHat
172.17.0.101 service_tag=XXXXXXX operating_system=RedHat
172.17.0.102 service_tag=XXXXXXX operating_system=openSUSE Leap
172.17.0.103 service_tag=XXXXXXX operating_system=Rocky
```

* To update all device inventories (Nodes will be excluded), run: `ansible-playbook configure_devices_cli.yml --tags=device_inventory`. Alternatively, run `ansible-playbook collect_device_info.yml`
* To update device inventories manually in the directory `/opt/omnia`, run `ansible-playbook collect_device_info.yml` from the `control_plane` folder. For updating the node inventory, run `ansible-playbook collect_node_info.yml` from the `control_plane` folder.
* For networking switches, InfiniBand switches, iDRAC, and PowerVault Storage, four inventories are available- **ethernet_inventory**, **infiniband_inventory**, **idrac_inventory**, **provisioned_idrac_inventory**, and **powervault_inventory** in `/opt/omnia/`
* IP addresses of the hosts are stored in **node_inventory** in the directory `/opt/omnia`.
* All device credentials used for configuration are taken from `login_vars.yml`.
* Schedules are created for the **node_inventory_job** (every **60 minutes**) and the **device_inventory_job** (**once daily**) to dynamically retrieve and update node and device details to `/opt/omnia`. Logs pertaining to these jobs are available in `/var/log/omnia/` in the folders `collect_node_info` and `collect_device_info`. These jobs can also be run manually using playbooks if required.
* Jobs initiated by control plane are logged here: `/var/log/omnia/<target device type>`. (Eg: /var/log/omnia/idrac, /var/log/omnia/powervault etc.)


## Configure devices

>> **Note**: To configure all devices without running `control_plane.yml`, run `ansible-playbook configure_devices_cli.yml`.

### [Ethernet Devices](Device_Configuration/Ethernet_Switches.md)
1. Verify that `/opt/omnia/ethernet_inventory` is created and updated with all ethernet switch IP details. This is done automatically when `control_plane.yml` is run. If it's not updated, run `ansible-playbook collect_device_info.yml` (dedicated NIC) or `ansible-playbook collect_node_info.yml` (LOM NIC) from the control_plane directory.
2. Run `ansible-playbook configure_devices_cli.yml --tags=ethernet`. Alternatively, the command `ansible-playbook ethernet.yml -i /opt/omnia/ethernet_inventory` can be used. <br>

### [Infiniband switches](Device_Configuration/Infiniband_Switches.md)
1. Verify that `/opt/omnia/infiniband_inventory` is created and updated with all infiniband switch IP details. This is done automatically when `control_plane.yml` is run. If it's not updated, run `ansible-playbook collect_device_info.yml` (dedicated NIC) or `ansible-playbook collect_node_info.yml` (LOM NIC) from the control_plane directory.
2. Run `ansible-playbook configure_devices_cli.yml --tags=infiniband`. Alternatively, the command `ansible-playbook infiniband.yml -i /opt/omnia/infiniband_inventory` can be used. <br>

### [Powervault Storage](Device_Configuration/PowerVault.md)
1. Verify that `/opt/omnia/powervault_inventory` is created and updated with all powervault IP details. This is done automatically when `control_plane.yml` is run. If it's not updated, run `ansible-playbook collect_device_info.yml` (dedicated NIC) or `ansible-playbook collect_node_info.yml` (LOM NIC) from the control_plane directory.
2. Run `ansible-playbook configure_devices_cli.yml --tags=powervault`. Alternatively, the command `ansible-playbook powervault.yml -i /opt/omnia/powervault_inventory` can be used. <br>

### [Servers](Device_Configuration/Servers.md)
1. Verify that `/opt/omnia/idrac_inventory` is created and updated with all iDRAC IP details. This is done automatically when `control_plane.yml` is run. If it's not updated, run `ansible-playbook collect_device_info.yml` from the control_plane directory.
2. Run `ansible-playbook configure_devices_cli.yml --tags=idrac`. Alternatively, the command `ansible-playbook idrac.yml -i /opt/omnia/idrac_inventory` can be used.  <br>

## Enable Red Hat subscription
Before running `omnia.yml`, it is mandatory that red hat subscription be set up on manager/ compute nodes running Red Hat.
* To set up Red hat subscription, fill in the [rhsm_vars.yml file](Input_Parameter_Guide/Control_Plane_Parameters/Device_Parameters/rhsm_vars.md). Once it's filled in, run the template using AWX or Ansible. <br>
* Ensure that `/opt/omnia/node_inventory` is populated with all required information. For information on how to re-run inventories manually, click [here](#updating-inventory).
* The flow of the playbook will be determined by the value of `redhat_subscription_method` in `rhsm_vars.yml`.
    - If `redhat_subscription_method` is set to `portal`, run the command: <br> `ansible-playbook rhsm_subscription.yml -i inventory -e redhat_subscription_username="<username>" -e redhat_subscription_password="<password>"`
    - If `redhat_subscription_method` is set to `satellite`, run the command: <br> `ansible-playbook rhsm_subscription.yml -i inventory -e redhat_subscription_activation_key="<activation-key>" -e redhat_subscription_org_id ="<org-id>"`

>> **Note**: If all nodes in `/opt/omnia/node_inventory` are running Redhat, use the inventory `/opt/omnia/node_inventory` to enable or disable Redhat subscription. For example, to enable subscription via portal method, use the command `ansible-playbook rhsm_subscription.yml -i /opt/omnia/node_inventory -e redhat_subscription_username="<username>" -e redhat_subscription_password="<password>"`

## Disable Red Hat subscription <br>
`ansible_playbook omnia/control_plane/rhsm_unregister.yml -i inventory`

## Installing clusters
* Ensure all inventories and groups are assigned per [Omnia Pre Requisites](PreRequisites/OMNIA_PreReqs.md).
* Fill out the required parameters in [omnia_config.yml](Input_Parameter_Guide/omnia_config.md).
* Verify that all nodes are assigned a group. Use the [linked example file](../examples/host_inventory_file.ini) as a reference.
* The `node_inventory` file in `opt/omnia` should have a list of all nodes (IPs) that are provisioned by Omnia. Assign groups to all nodes based on the below criteria:
    * The __manager__ group should have exactly 1 manager node.
    * The __compute__ group should have at least 1 node.
    * The __login_node__ group is optional. If present, it should have exactly 1 node.
    * The **nfs_node** group is optional. If powervault is configured by omnia control plane, then the host connected to the powervault (That is the nfs server) should be part of nfs_node group.
Run `omnia.yml` to create the cluster
`ansible-playbook omnia.yml -i inventory` 

>> **Note**:
>> * To skip the creation of a Kubernetes cluster, use the skip tag:  `ansible-playbook omnia.yml -i inventory --skip-tags kubernetes`
>> * To skip the creation of a Slurm cluster, use the skip tag:  `ansible-playbook omnia.yml -i inventory --skip-tags slurm`

## Installing job management tools
### Installing Jupyterhub <br>
`ansible-playbook platforms/jupyterhub.yml -i inventory`
### Installing Kubeflow <br>
`ansible-playbook platforms/kubeflow.yml -i inventory`

For more information on job management tools, [click here.](Installation_Guides/INSTALL_OMNIA_CLI.md#installing-jupyterhub-and-kubeflow-playbooks)

## Installing telemetry

Once `control_plane.yml` and `omnia.yml` are executed, run the following command from `omnia/telemetry`: <br>
`ansible-playbook telemetry.yml -i inventory`  (This command references the inventory created when running `omnia.yml`)

 >> **Note**: If slurm_telemetry_support is set to `false` in `telemetry_base_vars.yml`, run `ansible-playbook telemetry.yml`
