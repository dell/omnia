def main():

    Executes the main function.

    This function takes two command-line arguments: `ip_range` and `netmask`.
    It splits the `ip_range` argument by "-" and assigns the resulting values
    to `start_ip` and `end_ip`. It then calls the `is_static_range_within_netmask`
    function with the `start_ip`, `end_ip`, and `netmask` as arguments.
    
    If any exception occurs during the execution of the function, the `result`
    variable is set to False. Finally, the value of `result` is printed.

    Parameters:
        None

    Returns:
        None
